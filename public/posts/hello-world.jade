h1 Connecting existing git repository with an existing remote github repository
p This often happens to me whenever I start a new project:
ul
  li I start working locally on a brand new project
  li I go to GitHub and create a new repository for my project
  li Confused, start Google-ing how to connect the two of them

h2 How do I connect them?
p Here&rsquo;s what you need to do to connect your local git repo with your remote github repo:

script(src="https://gist.github.com/96994afc2d0dd5bc2053.js")

//- <script src="https://gist.github.com/1522091.js?file=router.js"></script>

p: pre
  | cd /my/local/project/path/
  | git init
  | git remote add --track master origin git@github.com:jorgepedret/foo.git
ul
  li CD into your local project directory
  li Run git init, if you havenâ€™t ran it yet
  li Connect the remote repo with your local repo

p Done!
p Now you can commit your changes, pull rebase and then push to your remote repository

p: pre
  | git add .
  | git commit -m "Initial commit"
  | git pull --rebase origin master
  | git push origin master

h2 Another way to do it
p Here&rsquo;s another way to connect your local repo with a remote github repo:
ul
  li Rename your local project directory
  li Clone your GitHub repo specifying the original directory
  li Move the original content to the new repository
  li Delete the temporary directory created in line 1

p: pre
  | mv my_project my_project_temp
  | git clone https://github.com/jorgepedret/foo.git my_project
  | cp -r ./my_project_temp/. my_project
  | rm -r ./my_project_temp

h2 What&rsquo;s the correct way to do it?
p The correct way to do it is to start your GitHub repository before starting to code. That way you can simply use git clone and then just start working on it.

p That&rsquo;s it! Thanks to <a href="#">Caius Theory</a> and <a href="#">Ciaran Walsh</a> for helping me find a solution for this problem.
